#' @title Kinship linking file for pairs of relatives in the NLSY79 and NLSY79 Children and Young Adults
#' 
#' @description This dataset specifies the relatedness coefficient (ie, '\code{R}') between
#' subjects in the same extended family.  Each row represents a unique
#' relationship pair.  An extended family with \eqn{k} subjects will have
#' \eqn{k}(\eqn{k}-1)/2 rows.  Typically, Subject1 is older while Subject2 is
#' younger.
#' 
#' The dataset contains Gen1 and Gen2 subjects.  "Gen1" refers to subjects in
#' the original NLSY79 sample (\url{http://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79.htm}).
#' "Gen2" subjects are the biological children of the Gen1 females -ie, those
#' in the NLSY79 Children and Young Adults sample
#' (\url{http://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79ch.htm)}.
#' 
#' Subjects will be in the same extended family if either: [1] they are Gen1
#' housemates, [2] they are Gen2 siblings, [3] they are Gen2 cousins (ie, they
#' have mothers who are Gen1 sisters in the NLSY79, [4] they are mother and
#' child (in Gen1 and Gen2, respectively), or [5] they are aunt|uncle and
#' niece|nephew (in Gen1 and Gen2, respectively).
#' 
#' The variables \code{Subject1Tag} and \code{Subject2Tag} uniquely identify
#' subjects.  For Gen2 subjects, the SubjectTag is identical to their CID (ie,
#' C00001.00 -the SubjectID assigned in the NLSY79-Children files).  However
#' for Gen1 subjects, the SubjectTag is their CaseID (ie, R00001.00), with
#' "00" appended.  This manipulation is necessary to identify subjects
#' uniquely in inter-generational datasets.  A Gen1 subject with an ID of 43
#' has a \code{SubjectTag} of 4300.  The SubjectTags of her four children
#' remain 4301, 4302, 4303, and 4304.
#' 
#' Level 5 of \code{RelationshipPath} (ie, AuntNiece) is gender neutral.  The
#' relationship could be either Aunt-Niece, Aunt-Nephew, Uncle-Niece, or
#' Uncle-Nephew.  If there's a widely-accepted gender-neutral term, please
#' tell me.
#' 
#' MZ twins have \code{R}=1.  DZ twins and full-siblings have \code{R}=.5.
#' Half-siblings have \code{R}=.25. Typical first-cousins have \code{R}=.125
#' Unrelated subjects have \code{R}=0 (this occasionally happens for
#' \code{Gen1Housemates}).  Other \code{R} coefficients are possible. ??Joe,
#' do you have an earlier paper that enumerates all the obscure combinations,
#' like half-cousins or an ambiguous AuntNiece??
#' 
#' @format A data frame with 11,075 observations on the following 5 variables.
#' There is one row per unique pair of subjects, irrespective of order.
#' \describe{ 
#'    \item{ExtendedID}{Identity of the extended family of the pair; it corresponds to the HHID in the NLSY79.  See References below.}
#'    \item{Subject1Tag}{Identity of the pair's first subject.  See Details below.} 
#'    \item{Subject2Tag}{Identity of the pair's second subject.  See Details below.}
#'    \item{R}{The pair's Relatedness coefficient.  See Details below.} 
#'    \item{RelationshipPath}{Specifies the relationship category of the pair.  This variable is a factor, with levels \code{Gen1Housemates}=1, \code{Gen2Siblings}=2, \code{Gen2Cousins}=3, \code{ParentChild}=4, \code{AuntNiece}=5.}

#' @seealso The \code{LinksPair79} dataset contains columns necessary for a
#' basic BG analysis.  The \code{\link{Links79PairExpanded}} dataset contains
#' further information that might be useful in more complicated BG analyses.

#' A tutorial that produces a similar dataset is
#' \url{http://www.nlsinfo.org/childya/nlsdocs/tutorials/linking_mothers_and_children/linking_mothers_and_children_tutorial.html}.
#' It provides examples in SAS, SPSS, and STATA.
#' 
#' The current dataset (ie, \code{Links79Pair}) can be saved as a CSV file
#' (comma-separated file) and imported into in other programs and languages.
#' In the R console, type the following two lines of code:
#' 
#' \code{library(NlsyLinks); data(Links79Pair)}
#' 
#' \code{write.csv(Links79Pair, "C:/BGDirectory/Links79Pair.csv")}
#' 
#' where \code{"C:/BGDirectory/"} is replaced by your preferred directory.
#' Remember to use forward slashes instead of backslashes; for instance, the
#' path \code{"C:\BGDirectory\Links79Pair.csv"} will be misinterpreted.
#' 
#' @references The NLSY79 variable HHID (ie, R00001.49) is the source for the
#' \code{ExtendedID} variable.  This is discussed at
#' \url{http://www.nlsinfo.org/nlsy79/docs/79html/79text/hhcomp.htm}. ** We
#' need an introduction reference/information for 'R'/Relatedness. **
#' 
#' @source Gen1 information comes from the May 15, 2010 release of the
#' \href{http://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79.htm}{NLSY79 sample}.  Gen2 information
#' comes from the Sept 15, 2010 release of the
#' \href{http://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79ch.htm}{NLSY79 Children and Young Adults
#' sample}.  Data were extracted with the NLS Investigator
