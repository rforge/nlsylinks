#' @title Kinship linking file for pairs of relatives.  It builds upon the \code{\link{Links79Pair}} dataset.
#' 
#' @description Please first read the documentation for \code{\link{Links79Pair}}.  That
#' dataset contains the same pairs/rows, but only a subset of the
#' variables/columns.
#' 
#' Specifies the relatedness coefficient (ie, `R') between subjects in the
#' same extended family.  Each row represents a unique relationship pair.  An
#' extended family with \eqn{k} subjects will have \eqn{k}(\eqn{k}-1)/2 rows.
#' Typically, Subject1 is older while Subject2 is younger.
#' 
#' Currently this dataset contains only Gen2 siblings.  However, it soon will
#' be generalized to the five categories specified by the
#' \code{RelationshipPath} variable.  Code written using this dataset should
#' NOT assume it contains only Gen2 sibiling pairs.  See an example of
#' filtering the relationship category in the in \code{\link{Links79Pair}}
#' documentation.

#' dataset contains the same pairs/rows, but only a subset of the
#' variables/columns.
#' 
#' 
#' The specific steps to determine the \code{R} coefficient will be described
#' in an upcoming publication.  The following information may influence the
#' decisions of an applied researcher.
#' 
#' 
#' A distinction is made between `Explicit' and `Implicit' information.
#' Explicit information comes from survey items that directly address the
#' subject's relationships.  For instance in 2006, surveys asked if the
#' sibling pair share the same biological father (eg, Y19940.00 and
#' T00020.00).  Implicit information comes from items where the subject
#' typically isn't aware that their responses may be used to determine genetic
#' relatedness.  For instance, if two siblings have biological fathers with
#' the same month of death (eg, R37722.00 and R37723.00), it may be reasonable
#' to assume they share the same biological father.
#' 
#' 
#' `Interpolation' is our lingo when other siblings are used to leverage
#' insight into the current pair.  For example, assume Subject 101, 102, and
#' 103 have the same mother.  Further assume 101 and 102 report they share a
#' biological father, and that 101 and 103 share one too.  Finally, assume
#' that we don't have information about the relationship between 102 and 103.
#' If we are comfortable with our level of uncertainty of these
#' determinations, then we can interpolate/infer that 102 and 103 are
#' full-siblings as well.
#' 
#' The math and height scores are duplicated from
#' \code{\link{ExtraOutcomes79}}, but are included here to make some examples
#' more concise and accessible.

#' @format A data frame with 11,075 observations on the following 22
#' variables.  There is one row per unique pair of subjects, irrespective of
#' order.  
#' \describe{
#' \item{ExtendedID}{see the variable of the same name in \code{\link{Links79Pair}}}

#' \item{R}{see the variable of the same name in \code{\link{Links79Pair}}} 
#' \item{RFull}{This is a superset of \code{R}.  This includes all the \emph{R} values we estimated, while \code{R} (i.e., the variable above) excludes values like \emph{R}=0 for \code{Gen1Housemates}, and the associated relationships based on this \emph{R} value (i.e., \code{Gen2Cousin}s and \code{AuntNiece}s).}
#' \item{RelationshipPath}{see the variable of the same name in \code{\link{Links79Pair}}} 
#' \item{EverSharedHouse}{Indicate if the pair likely live in the same house.  This is \code{TRUE} for \code{Gen1Housemates}, \code{Gen2Siblings}, and \code{ParentChild}. This is \code{FALSE} for \code{AuntNiece} and \code{Gen2Cousins}}

#####  ' %\item{\code{MultipleBirth}}{Indicates if the pair are twins (or triplets). This variable is a factor, with levels \code{No}=0, \code{Twin}=2, \code{Triplet}=3, \code{DoNotKnow}=255.} 

#' \item{IsMz}{Indicates if the pair is from the same zygote (ie, they are identical twins/triplets). This variable is a factor, with levels \code{No}=0, \code{Yes}=1, \code{DoNotKnow}=255.}

#' \item{RImplicit}{The pair's R coefficient, using only implicit information.  Interpolation was used.}
