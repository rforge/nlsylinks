## Locations for Help and Development

This repository contains the code used in the [NlsyLinks](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NlsyLinks/) R package.  For additional information about the package and using it in NLSY research, please see http://liveoak.github.io/NlsyLinks/

We now use  [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/LiveOak/NlsyLinksStaging) as our primary way of managing, tracking, and build-checking versions of the source code.  We continue to use the [R-Forge site](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/nlsylinks/) to make sure the most recent version builds on the different OS platforms, and passes the associated checks.  The stable releases (intended for most researchers) is available on the package's  [CRAN site](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NlsyLinks/).

The help forums remain on the package's [R-Forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/forum/?group_id=1330).
