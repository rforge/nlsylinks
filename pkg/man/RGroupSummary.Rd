\title{Calculates summary statistics for each \emph{R}elatedness Group in the sample.}
\usage{
  RGroupSummary(ds, oName_1, oName_2, rName,
    determinantThreshold=1e-5)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ds}{The \code{data.frame} containing the following
  variables:}

  \item{oName_1}{The name of the outcome variable
  corresponding to the first subject in the pair.}

  \item{oName_2}{The name of the outcome variable
  corresponding to the first subject in the pair.}

  \item{rName}{The name of the variable specifying the
  pair's \code{Relatedness} coefficient.}

  \item{determinantThreshold}{The minimum value the
  covariance matrix's determinant (for the group) should
  exceed to be considered Positive Definite.}
}
\value{
  A \code{data.frame} with one row per group.  The
  \code{data.frame} contains the following variables:
  \item{ R }{The group's \code{R} value.  Note the name of
  this variable can be changed by the user, by specifying a
  non-default value to the \code{rName} argument.} \item{
  Included }{Indicates if the group should be included in a
  multiple-group SEM.} \item{ PairCount }{The number of
  pairs in the group with \emph{complete} data for \code{R}
  and the two outcome/manifest variables.} \item{ O1Mean }{
  The mean (of the outcome variable) among the group's
  first members, excluding the missing values. } \item{
  O2Mean }{ The mean (of the outcome variable) among the
  group's second members, excluding the missing values. }
  \item{ O1Variance }{ The variance (of the outcome
  variable) among the group's first members. } \item{
  O2Variance }{ The variance (of the outcome variable)
  among the group's second members. } \item{ O1O2Covariance
  }{ The covariance (of the outcome variable) across the
  group's first and second members.} \item{ Correlation
  }{The correlation (of the outcome variable) across the
  group's first and second members.} \item{ Determinant }{
  The determinant of the group's covariance matrix.} \item{
  PosDefinite }{ Indicates if the group's covariance matrix
  is positive definite.}
}
\description{
  Before and after running ACE Models, it is important to
  examine the characteristics of the different groups.
  When the ACE is estimated with an SEM using multiple
  groups, it is even even more important.  Groups may
  contain too few subjects to have a well-behaved
  covariance matrix.

  If a group's covariance matrix is not Positive Definite
  (or it's misbehaving in some other way), it's typically
  recommended to exclude that group from the SEM.
}
\details{
  This function doesn't specific to an ACE model and groups
  defined by \code{R}.  It could be applied to any
  multiple-group SEM with two manifest/outcome variables.
  In the future, we may generalize it beyond two manifest
  variables.

  To get summary stats for the entire sample, create a
  dummy indicator variable that assigns everyone to the
  same group.  See the second example below.

  The default determinantThreshold value is nonzero, in
  order to forgive slight numerical inaccuracies caused by
  fixed-precision arithmetic.
