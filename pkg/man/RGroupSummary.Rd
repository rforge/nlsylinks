\title{
Calculates summary statistics for each \emph{R}elatedness Group in the sample.
}
\description{
Before and after running ACE Models, it is important to examine the characteristics of the different groups.  When the ACE is estimated with an SEM using multiple groups, it is even even more important.  Groups may contain too few subjects to have a well-behaved covariance matrix.  

If a group's covariance matrix is not Positive Definite (or it's misbehaving in some other way), it's typically recommended to exclude that group from the SEM. 
}
\usage{
RGroupSummary(ds, mName_1, mName_2, rName)
}

\arguments{
  \item{ds}{The \code{data.frame} containing the following variables:}
  \item{mName_1}{The name of the manifest variable corresponding to the first subject in the pair.}
  \item{mName_2}{The name of the manifest variable corresponding to the first subject in the pair.}
  \item{rName}{The name of the variable specifying the pair's \code{Relatedness} coefficient.}
}
\details{
This function doesn't specific to an ACE model and groups defined by \code{R}.  It could be applied to any multiple-group SEM with two manifest variables.  In the future, we may generalize it beyond two manifest variables.

To get summary stats for the entire sample, create a dummy indicator variable that assigns everyone to the same group.  See the second example below.
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with one row per group.  The \code{data.frame} contains the following variables:
\item{ R }{The group's \code{R} value.  Note the name of this variable can be changed by the user, by specifying a non-default value to the \code{rName} argument.}
\item{ Included }{Indicates if the group should be included in a multiple-group SEM.}
\item{ PairCount }{The number of pairs in the group with \emph{complete} data for \code{R} and the two manifest variables.}
\item{ M1Variance }{ The variance (of the manifest variable) among the group's first members. }
\item{ M2Variance }{ The variance (of the manifest variable) among the group's second members. }
\item{ M1M2Covariance }{ The covariance (of the manifest variable) across the group's first and second members.}
\item{ Correlation }{The correlation (of the manifest variable) across the group's first and second members.}
\item{ Determinant }{ The determinant of the group's covariance matrix.}
\item{ PosDefinite }{ Indicates if the group's covariance matrix is positive definite.}
