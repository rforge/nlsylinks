\title{Kinship linking file for pairs of relatives.  It builds upon the \code{\link{Links79Pair}} dataset.}
\format{A data frame with 11,075 observations on the following 22
variables.  There is one row per unique pair of subjects, irrespective of
order.
\describe{
\item{ExtendedID}{see the variable of the same name in \code{\link{Links79Pair}}}
\item{SubjectTag_S1}{see the variable of the same name in \code{\link{Links79Pair}}}
\item{SubjectTag_S2}{see the variable of the same name in \code{\link{Links79Pair}}}
\item{R}{see the variable of the same name in \code{\link{Links79Pair}}}
\item{RFull}{This is a superset of \code{R}.  This includes all the \emph{R} values we estimated, while \code{R} (i.e., the variable above) excludes values like \emph{R}=0 for \code{Gen1Housemates}, and the associated relationships based on this \emph{R} value (i.e., \code{Gen2Cousin}s and \code{AuntNiece}s).}
\item{RelationshipPath}{see the variable of the same name in \code{\link{Links79Pair}}}
\item{EverSharedHouse}{Indicate if the pair likely live in the same house.  This is \code{TRUE} for \code{Gen1Housemates}, \code{Gen2Siblings}, and \code{ParentChild}. This is \code{FALSE} for \code{AuntNiece} and \code{Gen2Cousins}}
\item{IsMz}{Indicates if the pair is from the same zygote (ie, they are identical twins/triplets). This variable is a factor, with levels \code{No}=0, \code{Yes}=1, \code{DoNotKnow}=255.}
\item{LastSurvey_S1}{The year of Subject1's most recently completed survey. This may be different that the survey's administration date.}
\item{LastSurvey_S2}{The year of Subject2's most recently completed survey. This may be different that the survey's administration date.}
\item{RImplicitPass1}{The pair's R coefficient, using only implicit information.  Interpolation was NOT used.}
\item{RImplicit}{The pair's R coefficient, using only implicit information.  Interpolation was used.}
\item{RImplicit2004}{The pair's R coefficient released in our previous projects (**need reference**).  This variable is provided primarily for previous users wishing to replicate previous analyses.}
\item{RExplicitPass1}{The pair's R coefficient, using only explicit information.  Interpolation was NOT used.}
\item{RExplicit}{The pair's R coefficient, using only explicit information.  Interpolation was used.}
\item{RExplicitOlderSibVersion}{The pair's R coefficient, according to the explicit item responses of the older sibling.}
\item{RExplicitYoungerSibVersion}{The pair's R coefficient, according to the explicit item responses of the younger sibling.}
\item{RPass1}{The pair's estimated R coefficient, using both implicit and explicit information.  Interpolation was NOT used.  The variable \code{R} is identically constructed, but it did use interpolation.}
\item{Generation_S1}{The generation of the first subject.  Values for Gen1 and Gen2 are \code{1} and \code{2}, respectively.}
\item{Generation_S2}{The generation of the second subject.  Values for Gen1 and Gen2 are \code{1} and \code{2}, respectively.}
\item{SubjectID_S1}{The ID value assigned by NLS to the first subject.  For Gen1 Subjects, this is their "CaseID" (ie, R00001.00).  For Gen2 subjects, this is their "CID" (ie, C00001.00).}
\item{SubjectID_S2}{The ID value assigned by NLS to the second subject.}
\item{MathStandardized_S1}{The PIAT-Math score for Subject1.  See \code{\link{ExtraOutcomes79}} for more information about its source.}
\item{MathStandardized_S2}{The PIAT-Math score for Subject2.}
\item{HeightZGenderAge_S1}{The early adult height for Subject1.  See \code{\link{ExtraOutcomes79}} for more information about its source.}
\item{HeightZGenderAge_S2}{The early adult height for Subject2.}

  Please first read the documentation for
  \code{\link{Links79Pair}}.  That dataset contains the
  same pairs/rows, but only a subset of the
  variables/columns.

  NOTE: In Nov 2013, the variable naming scheme changed in
  order to be more consistent across variables.  For
  variables that are measured separately for both subjects
  (eg, Gender), the subjects' variable name will have an
  \code{_S1} or \code{_S2} appended to it.  For instance,
  the variables \code{LastSurvey_S1} and
  \code{LastSurvey_S2} correspond to the last surveys
  completed by the pair's first and second subject,
  respectively.  Similarly, the functions
  \code{CreatePairLinksDoubleEntered} and
  \code{CreatePairLinksSingleEntered} now by default append
  \code{_S1} and \code{_S2}, instead of \code{_1} and
  \code{_2}.  However this can be modified using the
  `subject1Qualifier` and `subject2Qualifier` parameters.

\details{
  Specifies the relatedness coefficient (ie, `\code{R}')
  between subjects in the same extended family.  Each row
  represents a unique relationship pair.  An extended
  family with \eqn{k} subjects will have
  \eqn{k}(\eqn{k}-1)/2 rows. Typically, Subject1 is older
  while Subject2 is younger.

  \code{RelationshipPath} variable.  Code written using
  this dataset should NOT assume it contains only Gen2
  sibiling pairs.  See an example of filtering the
  relationship category in the in \code{\link{Links79Pair}}
  documentation.

  Please first read the documentation for
  \code{\link{Links79Pair}}.  That dataset contains the
  same pairs/rows, but only a subset of the
  variables/columns.

  The specific steps to determine the \code{R} coefficient
  will be described in an upcoming publication.  The
  following information may influence the decisions of an
  applied researcher.

  A distinction is made between `Explicit' and `Implicit'
  information. Explicit information comes from survey items
  that directly address the subject's relationships.  For
  instance in 2006, surveys asked if the sibling pair share
  the same biological father (eg, Y19940.00 and T00020.00).
  Implicit information comes from items where the subject
  typically isn't aware that their responses may be used to
  determine genetic relatedness.  For instance, if two
  siblings have biological fathers with the same month of
  death (eg, R37722.00 and R37723.00), it may be reasonable
  to assume they share the same biological father.

  `Interpolation' is our lingo when other siblings are used
  to leverage insight into the current pair.  For example,
  assume Subject 101, 102, and 103 have the same mother.
  Further assume 101 and 102 report they share a biological
  father, and that 101 and 103 share one too.  Finally,
  assume that we don't have information about the
  relationship between 102 and 103. If we are comfortable
  with our level of uncertainty of these determinations,
  then we can interpolate/infer that 102 and 103 are
  full-siblings as well.

  The math and height scores are duplicated from
  \code{\link{ExtraOutcomes79}}, but are included here to
  make some examples more concise and accessible.
