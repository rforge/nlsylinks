\title{
A simple multiple-group ACE model with the \pkg{lavaan} package.
}
\description{
This function uses the \pkg{lavaan} package to estimate a univariate ACE model, using multiple groups.  Each group has a unique value of \code{R} (i.e., the \emph{R}elatedness coefficient).
}
\usage{
AceLavaanGroup(dsClean, estimateA=TRUE, estimateC=TRUE, printOutput=FALSE)
%AceLavaanGroup(dsClean, rLevels, oName_1, oName_2, rName="R", 
%  estimateA=TRUE, estimateC=TRUE, printOutput=FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{dsClean}{The \code{data.frame} containing complete cases for the \code{R} groups to be included in the estimation.}
%  \item{rLevels}{The values of \code{R} forming each group.}
%  \item{oName_1}{The name of the manifest variable for the \emph{first} subject in each pair.}
%  \item{oName_2}{The name of the manifest variable for the \emph{second} subject in each pair.}
%  \item{rName}{The name of the variable containing the \code{R} value.}
  \item{estimateA}{Should the \emph{A} variance component be estimated?  A^2 represents the proportion of variability due to a shared genetic influence.}
  \item{estimateC}{Should the \emph{C} variance component be estimated?  C^2 represents the proportion of variability due to a shared environmental influence.}
  \item{printOutput}{Indicates if the estimated parameters and fit statistics are printed to the console.}
}
\details{
The variance component for \emph{E} is always estimated.

}
\value{
An \code{AceEstimate} object.

\references{
The \pkg{lavaan} package is developed by Yves Rosseel at Ghent University.  Two good starting points are the documentation (\url{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lavaan/}) and his upcoming JSS paper (\url{http://users.ugent.be/~yrosseel/lavaan/lavaanJSSpreview.pdf}).

\note{
Currently, the variables in \code{dsClean} must be named \code{M1}, \code{M2} and \code{R}.  This may not be as restrictive as it initially seems, because \code{dsClean} is intented to be produced by \code{CleanSemAceDataset}.  If this is too restrictive for your uses, we'd like to here about it (\emph{please email wibeasley at hotmail period com}).
