\title{Kinship linking file for pairs of relatives in the NLSY79 and NLSY79 Children and Young Adults}
\format{A data frame with 42,773 observations on the following 5 variables.
There is one row per unique pair of subjects, irrespective of order.
\describe{
   \item{ExtendedID}{Identity of the extended family of the pair; it corresponds to the HHID in the NLSY79.  See References below.}
   \item{SubjectTag_S1}{Identity of the pair's first subject.  See Details below.}
   \item{SubjectTag_S2}{Identity of the pair's second subject.  See Details below.}
   \item{R}{The pair's Relatedness coefficient.  See Details below.}
   \item{RelationshipPath}{Specifies the relationship category of the pair.  This variable is a factor, with levels \code{Gen1Housemates}=1, \code{Gen2Siblings}=2, \code{Gen2Cousins}=3, \code{ParentChild}=4, \code{AuntNiece}=5.}

\description{
  This dataset specifies the relatedness coefficient (ie,
  `\code{R}') between subjects in the same extended family.
  Each row represents a unique relationship pair.

  NOTE: Two variable names changed in November 2013.
  \code{Subject1Tag} and \code{Subject2Tag} became
  \code{SubjectTag_S1} and \code{SubjectTag_S2}.
}
\details{
  The dataset contains Gen1 and Gen2 subjects.  "Gen1"
  refers to subjects in the original NLSY79 sample
  (\url{http://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79.htm}). "Gen2"
  subjects are the biological children of the Gen1 females
  -ie, those in the NLSY79 Children and Young Adults sample
  (\url{http://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79ch.htm)}.

  Subjects will be in the same extended family if either:
  [1] they are Gen1 housemates, [2] they are Gen2 siblings,
  [3] they are Gen2 cousins (ie, they have mothers who are
  Gen1 sisters in the NLSY79, [4] they are mother and child
  (in Gen1 and Gen2, respectively), or [5] they are
  aunt|uncle and niece|nephew (in Gen1 and Gen2,
  respectively).

  The variables \code{SubjectTag_S1} and
  \code{SubjectTag_S2} uniquely identify subjects.  For
  Gen2 subjects, the SubjectTag is identical to their CID
  (ie, C00001.00 -the SubjectID assigned in the
  NLSY79-Children files).  However for Gen1 subjects, the
  SubjectTag is their CaseID (ie, R00001.00), with "00"
  appended.  This manipulation is necessary to identify
  subjects uniquely in inter-generational datasets.  A Gen1
  subject with an ID of 43 has a \code{SubjectTag} of 4300.
  The SubjectTags of her four children remain 4301, 4302,
  4303, and 4304.

  Level 5 of \code{RelationshipPath} (ie, AuntNiece) is
  gender neutral.  The relationship could be either
  Aunt-Niece, Aunt-Nephew, Uncle-Niece, or Uncle-Nephew.
  If there's a widely-accepted gender-neutral term, please
  tell me.

  An extended family with \eqn{k} subjects will have
  \eqn{k}(\eqn{k}-1)/2 rows.  Typically, Subject1 is older
  while Subject2 is younger.

  MZ twins have \emph{R}=1.  DZ twins and full-siblings
  have \emph{R}=.5. Half-siblings have \emph{R}=.25.
  Typical first cousins have \emph{R}=.125. Unrelated
  subjects have \emph{R}=0 (this occasionally happens for
  \code{Gen1Housemates}).  Other \emph{R} coefficients are
  possible.

  There are several other uncommon possibilities, such as
  half-cousins (\emph{R}=.0625) and ambiguous aunt-nieces
  (\emph{R}=.125). The variable coding for genetic
  relatedness,\code{R}, in \code{Links79Pair} contains only
  the common values of \emph{R} whose groups are likely to
  have stable estimates. However the variable \code{RFull}
  in \code{Links79PairExpanded} contains all \emph{R}
  values. We strongly recommend using \code{R} in this
  \code{data.frame}.  Move to \code{RFull} (or some
  combination) only if you have a good reason, and are
  willing to carefully monitor a variety of validity
  checks.  Some of these excluded groups are too small to
  be estimated reliably.

  Furthermore, some of these groups have members who are
  more strongly genetically related than their items would
  indicate. For instance, there are 41 Gen1 pairs who
  explicitly claim they are not biologically related
  (\emph{ie}, \code{RExplicit}=0), yet their correlation
  for Adult Height is \emph{r}=0.24.  This is much higher
  than would be expected for two people sampled randomly;
  it is nearly identical to the \emph{r}=0.26 we observed
  among the 268 Gen1 half-sibling pairs who claim they
  share exactly 1 biological parent.

  The current dataset (ie, \code{Links79Pair}) can be saved
  as a CSV file (comma-separated file) and imported into in
  other programs and languages. In the R console, type the
  following two lines of code:

  \code{library(NlsyLinks)}

  \code{write.csv(Links79Pair,
  "C:/BGDirectory/Links79Pair.csv")}

  where \code{"C:/BGDirectory/"} is replaced by your
  preferred directory. Remember to use forward slashes
  instead of backslashes; for instance, the path
  \code{"C:\BGDirectory\Links79Pair.csv"} can be
  misinterpreted.
