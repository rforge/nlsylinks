\title{
Creates a \code{SubjectTag}.  This value uniquely identifies subjects, when both generations are included in the same dataset.
}
\description{
A \code{SubjectTag} uniquely identify subjects.  For Gen2 subjects, the SubjectTag is identical to their CID (ie, C00001.00 -the SubjectID assigned in the NLSY79-Children files).  However for Gen1 subjects, the SubjectTag is their CaseID (ie, R00001.00), with "00" appended.  This manipulation is necessary to identify subjects uniquely in inter-generational datasets.  A Gen1 subject with an ID of 43 becomes 4300.  The SubjectTags of her four children remain 4301, 4302, 4303, and 4304.
}
\usage{
CreateSubjectTag(subjectID, generation)
}

\arguments{
  \item{subjectID}{The ID assigned by the NLSY.  For Gen1 subjects, this will be their CaseID (ie, R00001.00).  For Gen2 subjects, this will be their CID (ie, C00001.00).}
  \item{generation}{The generation of the subject.  Values are either 1 or 2, representing Gen1 and Gen2.  Note that this variable is not a \code{factor} (in constrast with data frames like \code{\link{Links79Pair}}).   This dataset is supposed to mimick the dataset provided by the researcher, which typically will not have been converted to a \code{factor}.

\details{
For a fuller explanation of \code{SubjectTag} in context, see the \code{\link{Links79Pair}} dataset documentation.
}
\value{
A integer value under normal circumstances.

An error is thrown if the vectors \code{subjectID} and \code{generation} are different lengths.

If either input vector has NA values, the respective output element(s) will be NA too.
